As a course and a student body, we are more remote than usual, and
preferable. To help bridge the chasm, I will leverage some of the
technology platforms Northeastern makes available to us.

## [Duo 2FA](https://get2fa.northeastern.edu/)

Most if not all students will already have enrolled themselves for the
Duo 2FA system. It is essential that you do so to access
Northeastern's digital resources. Northeastern has at least two
tutorials for installing and using the Duo 2FA system:

   - [The express version](https://express.northeastern.edu/get2fa/how-to-enroll-in-2fa/)
   - [The ~servicenow~ guide, (with pictures)](https://northeastern.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sys_kb_id=436cd1dbdb808854c5575e38dc9619e3&sysparm_class_name=kb_knowledge)

## Piazza 

[Piazza.com](http://piazza.com/) hosts our main Q&A forum. We are everyone learning; no one
knows all the answers, and remember that everyone wears their best and
most knowledgeable face. For questions related to the course material,
assignments, policies, or what have you, please utilize Piazza. I
generally prefer anonymous Piazza posts over email---this way others
get the benefit of your thoughtful question and answers and
corrections scale to the size of our class. Please do anonymize them
if you wish; we can see even if you cannot. Frequently someone will
have the same concern or be feeling the same way.

 If it doesn't "give away the punchline" of some homework question or
 assignment, *necessitate* PII in the question or the answer, and isn't
 contrary to FERPA or your rights under the Northeastern University
 Handbook, please do consider if this can be a Piazza message.

## [KCCS/CCIS/CCS Github](http://ccs.github.neu.edu)

I will be utilizing the school's Enterprise git at
[http://ccs.github.neu.edu]. You should have access to that with your
KCCS account. I will expect you to know how to access this, for your
own benefits and for coursework. If you are not familiar, please
consult the Khoury Systems group's [documentation and
walk-through](https://northeastern.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0012152).

## [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is)

[Register here](https://hypothes.is/signup) for Hypothes.is, the collaborative editing tool. I will
expect student to collaboratively edit and annotate certain notes and
documents. As you read complete the reading assignments, you will
often find areas that are less clear than others, or sub-optimally
ordered, or deficient in a variety of other ways.

Chrome users can download and install the [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bjfhmglciegochdpefhhlphglcehbmek), if you
wish. Users of other browsers can [install the bookmarklet](https://web.hypothes.is/start/#chrome-missing:~:text=For%20any%20browser%2C%20drag%20this%20button,or%20right%2Dclick%2Fcontrol%2Dclick%20to%20bookmark%20the%20link.). I will link
all our ~.pdf~ documents via hypothesis. FYI, if you are on an Android
device, you can send any page to hypothesis via the [following app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.navasgroup.annoteweb).

## Course Homepage

I constructed our course homepage as a Jekyll site built with Github
Pages. Student corrections and improvements are *incredibly* welcome!
You can submit a [pull request
(PR)](http://github.ccs.neu.edu/jhemann/21SP-CS5963) for a quick
correction and improvement. Every page on this website has a direct
links to its ~.md~ file in this repository.

## Canvas 

It is my intention to use Canvas solely to collect and maintain our
grades. 
      
## Handin Server

We will use the [Handin server](http://handins.ccs.neu.edu/) (bottlenose) to submit. You
might have experience with this platform from Fundies I; if you
do not, please read the [Handin Server Guide](http://ccs.neu.edu/home/blerner/handin-server/handin-server-guide.html). 

## Zoom 

I intend to broadcast our course meetings via [Northeastern Zoom](https://northeastern.zoom.us/). I
prefer it over MS Teams for a variety of reasons. Not the least of
which is the instantaneous and anonymous feedback that it provides,
via [Dial testing](http://dialsmith.com/blog/dial-tests-vs-focus-groups-how-are-they-different/). You will find it helpful to have two
internet-enabled devices with at hand when you are attending class
remotely, once for viewing the class and a second for answering poll
questions.

### Via direct installation. 

If you have difficulty installing or using the platform please see
ITS' associated [KB article](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us) or contact [Zoom support](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us).

### Via the browser

You also have the option to join without downloading or installing any
software, via the [Zoom web client](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/214629443-Zoom-web-client). The web client does not have all
the functionality of the desktop or mobile apps; please see the
comparison [here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360027397692#query:~:text=Note%3A,-We). 

## NEU VPN 

Go to [http://vpn.northeastern.edu](http://vpn.northeastern.edu), and follow the instructions to
install the GlobalProctect VPN client on your machine. You will need
this to use the VDI linux machines. If you have difficulty please
consult the [relevant ITS KB articles](http://northeastern.service-now.com/tech?id=kb_category&kb_category=07d42f714f02cf0099c2fd511310c7b2), and if necessary [reach out to
ITS support](http://its.northeastern.edu/support/#et-boc:~:text=Still%20Need%20Support%3F).

<!-- ## Applause!  -->

<!-- One of the things I miss most about real, in-person classrooms is -->
<!-- being able to applaud someone for a job well done, and for getting up -->
<!-- and giving it a shot. Here's our [best -->
<!-- alternative](https://applause.haggett.org/FA20-2800). If each of us -->
<!-- goes here and enters his or her name then, when one of us presses the -->
<!-- applause button, we can all see and hear it.  -->
