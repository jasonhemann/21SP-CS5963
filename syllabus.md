# Recognition

This is a one credit, three week, pass/fail course over winter
break. I am fully aware that the other CS option is "Science Fiction
in Computer Science." I am fully aware that not everyone comes in with
recent programming experience in a functional language. This will not
be a course over which you should stress out. I want to pique your
interests, to give you the opportunity to dig in as far as you wish,
and (I hope) to spark in you an interest to continue to do more.

This will not be a course that frustrates you or expects prerequisites
in order for you to enjoy. I plan to start with DrRacket 101 and go
from there. 

# Purpose

The 2021 edition of CS5963 will introduce you to practical uses of
relational, constraint, and logic programming, from the ground up. It
will also introduces students to applications in other areas of
computer science, education, and medical research. 

## Objectives

After this course you will be able to 

  1. Make rudimentary use of an embedded relational programming language
  2. Compare and contrast definitions of functions and relations. 
  2. Understand generally the use of relational programs in applications.

# Contact

The best way to get in contact for personal, private (FERPA, etc)
messages is via my email address
[jhemann@northeastern.edu](mailto:jhemann@northeastern.edu). You
should expect a response within 48 hours. You will find that I am
faster with [Piazza](Piazza) or our public forums. If I deem it even
potentially useful to others, I will likely anonymize your letter,
re-post it on Piazza, answer it there, and forward you the link.

A great regular way to reach out for help is via our [office
hours]({{ site.baseurl }}/office-hours/).

# Assessment 

We will not have [attendance](Attendance) or a final exam component. Instead, our
course will have a single, solitary [project](Projects) component. I
intend this project to be a lay-up. I want to set the bar for "Pass"
so low that a student can trip over it. I want plenty of opportunities
to surpass this level. I want you to go far beyond the minimum
threshold. But three weeks is enough to demonstrate, to acculturate,
and to exhibit. I do not believe it is enough time to develop mastery
of a full new skill. And we have folk from diverse enough backgrounds
that we cannot all narrowly target in on one particular new skill if
we want to. 

I don't want to frighten anyone who wasn't signing up for a
programming/implementation course. Nor do I want to bore experienced
miniKanren programmers looking to hone their skills. I don't want
anyone feeling in over his or her head a week and a half in. 

I highly encourage you to attend every session. I will try match your
enthusiasm and interest, to show you things you find exciting, and to
give you as much challenge as you want without ever becoming
overwhelmed or nervous.

## Attendance 

We will not be taking attendance except as requested by the registrar. 

# Recordings

I will not record our class sessions on either audio or video. When
appropriate, I will have on this course website some sets of lecture
notes and in-class work. You can also take advantage of our TA staff.

# Projects 

The sole assessment this minimester is a single project. You will
complete this individually or in pairs. Each of you will submit this,
via [Handins]({{ site.baseurl }}/tech/), by end of day (11:59pm
Boston-time) on Sunday January 17.

## Default Project 

By default, your task will be to implement your own embedding of a
`Kanren` language. If you have not implemented a programming language
before, that could sound scary. You should be less concerned because:

 1. I will implement the same in front of you live, in class.
 2. One can typically write this implementation in <= 40m. 
 3. You can implement it in as few as 30 lines of code. 
 4. You will find 100+ exemplary implementations on
    [miniKanren.org](https://minikanren.org).
 5. Our course staff are polyglot programming experts. 


## Alternate/Additional Project Option

I want to give students an opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the
material in a way that resonates with you. If you feel like you need
or want more, or that your current assessments haven't sufficiently
demonstrated your understanding, you (we) can come up with something
else for you to do. Please speak with me. There is plenty more to do. 

One way to proceed is to implement or have implemented an
implementation of above, and then to extend it from there with some
features you find more interesting. Another choice is to start on
something more exciting, or application driven, and to keep the other
option in your back pocket. 

# Academic Integrity Policy

Students of course play an integral part in ensuring they receive the
full benefit of their coursework. The students of 5963 are certainly
beholden to the academic integrity policies of [Northeastern
University](http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/),
the [Khoury
College](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/information-for-overview/current-undergrad/undergraduate-advising-academic-support/academic-policies/). There
are so many existing implementations though, and the features are so
minimal that simply showing how to use your implementation is
almost indistinguishable to me from having written it from scratch.

## Teamwork and Collaboration

Pair programming is a central part of the undergraduate curriculum
here. Pair programming is not intended to divide-and-conquer, but
instead for students to collaboratively solve problems together. You
are only twice as fast working separately if the typing is by and away
the hardest part of programming. Which it is not.

Ultimately, you should be responsible for and have a firm
understanding of all work submitted under your name. You should be
able to demonstrate this mastery when requested. 

# Required Texts 

There are no required texts for this course. I will post to the
Schedule page select chapters from The Reasoned Schemer, and a number
of links to workshops and presentations, conference talks, or research
papers. You may also find more on the Readings page.

# Academic Accommodations 

If you have accommodations from the [Disability Resource Center
(DRC)](http://www.northeastern.edu/drc/) please submit your Professor
Notification Letter to me by email, preferably within the first two
weeks of the quarter, so I can do my part to help you achieve equal
access in this course. I am eager to discuss ways we can ensure your
full participation.

I encourage all students who may benefit from learning more about DRC
services to [contact the
DRC](http://www.northeastern.edu/drc/#fp-blog-entry:~:text=Contact%20Information).

# Technology and Platforms

As a course and a student body, we are more remote than usual, and
preferable. We will leverage a number of Northeastern's technology
platforms to help bridge the chasm. Your first lab assignment will
walk you through installing and configuring these.

We will use a variety of tools and platforms to facilitate teaching
and learning at a somewhat remote distance and to compensate for this
unconventional semester. These include DrRacket, Piazza, Canvas, Zoom,
PollEverywhere, and Hypothes.is. Please see the [technology page]({{
site.baseurl }}/tech/) for more details.

# Health and Safety

The university has put into place a robust plan to make the campus
healthy and safe for all — but you must do your part. On August 22, all
students received an
[email](https://news.northeastern.edu/coronavirus/university-messages/university-response-to-unsafe-behavior/)
from Senior Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Madeleine Estabrook on
the expectations for behavior both on campus and off campus. **Please
read it carefully today.**

To summarize:

* Gatherings on or off campus must conform to healthy practices as
  outlined by university and [Massachusetts state
  guidance](https://www.mass.gov/doc/revised-gatherings-order-august-7-2020).
  If you host or attend an inappropriate party or gathering, you run the
  very real risk of immediate removal from the community.

* Wear a mask indoors and outdoors as you maintain a 6-foot distance
  from everyone.

* Get tested every three days using the COVID-19 Test Scheduler
  ([covid19-testing.northeastern.edu](https://northeastern.sharepoint.com/sites/covidscheduler).)
  We may require more frequent testing as the semester progresses. It’s
  quick, easy and will help us to quickly identify and care for anyone
  who tests positive. I will not be told the identity of anyone who
  tests positive, and you do not need to share that information with me
  or anyone else unless you want to. If you receive a positive test
  result, you will be contacted by a member of the university’s
  telehealth team who will provide you with next steps.

* Do a Daily Wellness Check
  ([wellness-check.northeastern.edu](https://wellness-check.northeastern.edu)),
  wash your hands well and regularly, and disinfect high-touch surfaces
  and spaces.

* I will be wearing a [face
  covering](https://news.northeastern.edu/coronavirus/reopening/frequently-asked-questions/#reopening)
  or mask as I teach and expect that you will do the same in class. If
  you come to class without a mask, I’ll ask you to go and [get one on
  campus](https://news.northeastern.edu/coronavirus/reopening/policies-and-protocols/#face-covering-protocol).
  You can get a mask at the Visitor Center or at the Curry Student
  Center Help Desk. If you refuse to wear a mask in class, I won’t be
  able to continue the class. If you are not sitting six feet apart from
  your classmate, I’ll ask you to do so. We won’t be able to eat or
  drink in class (except water). If you test positive, you will need to
  enter isolation as directed by the university’s telehealth team. I
  expect that you will not come in-person to class and that you will
  follow the guidance from the university telehealth team to isolate and
  get appropriate healthcare if needed.

* Staying safe is a responsibility that we all must take seriously.
  Keep in mind the “Protect the Pack” theme. Remember that our
  individual actions will help everyone stay safe this Spring."
