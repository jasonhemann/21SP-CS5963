> "Mathematics is concerned only with the enumeration and comparison of relations."
> ― Carl Friedrich Gauss

Welcome to the intercession "Relational and Logic Programming with
miniKanren" course. We hope this will be an education and enjoyable
experience for students with some experience and also for those
students coming in very fresh. We will experiment with some uses of
and implementation of a relational programming language.
